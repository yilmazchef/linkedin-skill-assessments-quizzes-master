- [ ] Y = in a message box and then a subsequent error message

#### Q36. The VBA code block shown in the following four options runs when UserForm1's CommandButton1 button is clicked. Which block of code leaves UserFrom1 loaded but not visible until the FoundErrors function has checked it, and then enables processing to continue if no errors are found?

```
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()
If FoundErrors(Me) Then _
Me.Show
End Sub
```

- [ ]

```
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()
If Not FoundErrors(UserForm1) Then _
Unload UserForm1
End Sub
```

- [x]

```
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()
Me.Hide
Do While FoundErrors(Me)
Me.Show
Loop
End Sub
```

- [ ]

```
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()
Do While FoundErrors(UserForm1)
UserForm1.show
Loop
End Sub
```

> The first requirement is to make UserForm1 loaded but not visible, therefore we need Me.Hide, **Me** in here referring to UserForm1
